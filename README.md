## 🚀 Usage

### Saving Content

The primary way to save content to Kiler is through the Android Share Sheet:

1.  In any app (like your browser, gallery, or a social media app), tap the **Share** button.
2.  Select **Kiler** from the list of applications.
3.  Kiler will process the content:
    *   **Links:** Fetches the page title and a preview image.
    *   **Images:** Saves the image directly to the app.
    *   **Text:** Saves the text snippet.
4.  A confirmation screen will appear, allowing you to add an optional note before saving the item to your archive.

### Managing Your Archive

Inside the app, you can manage all your saved items. Each item card provides several options:

-   **📝 Edit:** Add or change the note associated with an item.
-   **🔗 Share:** Share the content out to another application.
-   **📋 Copy:** Copy the link, text, or image to the clipboard.
-   **🗑️ Delete:** Permanently remove the item from your Kiler.
